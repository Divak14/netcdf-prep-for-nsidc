# netcdf-prep-for-nsidc

Struggling to create NetCDF files that are compatible across platforms for publishing Earth science data? This repository offers a streamlined, open-source Python workflow for generating NetCDF files that adhere to the metadata and formatting standards of the NASA NSIDC DAAC. Designed for use with your own datasets, the workflow enables the creation of publication-ready, interoperable data products that can be easily shared and accessed by the broader scientific community using tools like QGIS, Panoply, or cloud-based platforms.

# üõ∞Ô∏è NSIDC DAAC Data Preparation & NetCDF Conversion

This repository provides a complete, reproducible Python-based workflow for preparing and formatting Earth science data files according to the standards set by the **NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC)**. The process includes metadata structuring, data cleaning, NetCDF conversion, and visualization.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- `Demo.ipynb` ‚Äî Main Jupyter Notebook outlining the end-to-end process:
  - Loading sample data
  - Converting variables to proper formats
  - Generating compliant NetCDF files
  - Reading and visualizing output

## üìä Dataset Description

The notebook uses a sample dataset:
> **SMAP-Derived 9-km EASE-Grid Surface Soil Permittivity and Vegetation Optical Depth over Snow-Covered Regions, Version 1**  
> [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aebtehaj/SM-Snow-L-band)

This product provides daily 9-km resolution estimates of:
- Surface Soil Permittivity
- Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD)

Retrieved using the **Tau-Omega-Snow (TO-Snow)** emission model and validated with external ecological and climate variables.

## üõ†Ô∏è Standards and Guidelines

The data formatting and metadata follow the official standards outlined by:
- [NASA Earth Science Data Standards](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/standards)
- [NSIDC NetCDF Attribute Guidelines (PDF)](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/documents/other/nsidc-guidelines-netcdf-attributes.pdf)

## üß∞ Dependencies

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:
```
numpy
scipy
xarray
netCDF4
matplotlib
h5py
```

## üìà Visualization Tools

The output NetCDF files can be opened and visualized in:
- [Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/)
- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)
- Python tools like `xarray` and `matplotlib`
